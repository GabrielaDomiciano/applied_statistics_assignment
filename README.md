## Introduction 📊📈

This project was developed as part of the 25/2 assessment for a Applied Statistics.  
The goal of the assessment is to explore key concepts of **statistical inference** using **simulation**, implemented in **Python** with Jupyter Notebook.

Throughout the project, I use computational simulations to better understand theoretical ideas such as:

- Randomisation and probability
- Sampling distributions
- Type I and Type II errors
- Statistical power
- t-tests and ANOVA

Instead of relying only on formulas, simulations are used to illustrate how these concepts behave in practice.

All problems are implemented in a single notebook: **`problems.ipynb`**, following the instructions provided in `problems.md`.

## Project Structure 📁

- `problems.ipynb` — Main notebook containing all solutions, explanations, and plots  
- `problems.md` — Assessment questions provided by the lecturer  
- `README.md` — Project overview and setup instructions  
- `.gitignore` — Git configuration file  

---

The project was developed using:

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy** — numerical computing and simulation  
- **SciPy** — statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA)  
- **Matplotlib** — data visualisation  

Some parts of the code (especially interactive elements and refactoring) were developed with the assistance of **AI tools (OpenAi and VS Code AI)**, used mainly for clarification, structure, and code explanation, the code was reviewed, adapted.

**Example prompts used:**
- *"How can I structure this simulation more clearly in a Jupyter Notebook?"*
- *"Explain the difference between type I and type II errors with an example."*

## Problems Overview 🧪

### Problem 1 — Lady Tasting Tea
Simulation of Fisher’s classic experiment and an extended version with more cups, comparing exact and simulated probabilities.

### Problem 2 — Normal Distribution
Comparison between sample and population standard deviation using repeated sampling from a normal distribution.

### Problem 3 — t-Tests and Type II Error
Simulation study showing how the type II error rate and statistical power change as the true difference in means increases.

### Problem 4 — ANOVA
Comparison between one-way ANOVA and multiple pairwise t-tests, with a discussion of why ANOVA is preferred.
