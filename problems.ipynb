    "# Simulation and Statistical Inference Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains four simulation-based problems designed to explore key concepts in statistical inference, using Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib). Each problem focuses on understanding core ideas through Monte Carlo simulation and visualization.\n",

    "## Problem 1 — Extending the Lady Tasting Tea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Extend the classic Lady Tasting Tea experiment by increasing the number of cups. Simulate random guessing to estimate the probability of correctly identifying all cups by chance in both the original and extended setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**  \n",
    "- Combinatorics and probability by chance  \n",
    "- Simulation using random sampling  \n",
    "- Interpretation of p-values and significance levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**  \n",
    "1. Describe the original experiment (8 cups: 4 tea-first, 4 milk-first).  \n",
    "2. Extend it to 12 cups (8 tea-first, 4 milk-first).  \n",
    "3. Simulate many random guesses.  \n",
    "4. Estimate and compare the probabilities.  \n",
    "5. Discuss implications for statistical significance.\n",

    "## Problem 2 — Normal Distribution and Sample vs Population SD\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Compare the behavior of the sample standard deviation (`ddof=1`) and population standard deviation (`ddof=0`) when sampling from a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**  \n",
    "- Sampling variation  \n",
    "- Bias in estimators  \n",
    "- The effect of sample size on variability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**  \n",
    "1. Generate multiple samples from a standard normal distribution.  \n",
    "2. Compute SDs using both `ddof=1` and `ddof=0`.  \n",
    "3. Visualize the distributions with overlaid histograms.  \n",
    "4. Interpret the differences and how they change with larger sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 3 — Type II Error and t-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Simulate the behavior of Type II errors in t-tests as the difference between population means increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**  \n",
    "- Type I and Type II errors  \n",
    "- Power of a statistical test  \n",
    "- The relationship between effect size and error rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**  \n",
    "1. Define a range of true mean differences (d = 0 to 1).  \n",
    "2. Generate two samples for each d.  \n",
    "3. Perform an independent t-test.  \n",
    "4. Record how often the null hypothesis is not rejected.  \n",
    "5. Plot the Type II error rate as a function of d.  \n",
    "6. Discuss how power increases with effect size.\n",

    "## Problem 4 — ANOVA vs Multiple t-Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Compare results from one-way ANOVA with results from multiple two-sample t-tests when analyzing group mean differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**  \n",
    "- ANOVA as an omnibus test  \n",
    "- Multiple comparisons problem  \n",
    "- Controlling Type I error (family-wise error rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**  \n",
    "1. Generate three independent samples from normal distributions with different means.  \n",
    "2. Run a one-way ANOVA.  \n",
    "3. Perform pairwise t-tests (with and without correction).  \n",
    "4. Compare results and conclusions.  \n",
    "5. Explain why ANOVA is preferred before multiple t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Step:**  \n",
    "Begin implementing **Problem 1** — set up your imports, initialize the random generator, and outline the simulation logic for the Lady Tasting Tea extension.\n"
