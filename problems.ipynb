    "### Lady Tasting Tea — Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we look at the classic *Lady Tasting Tea* experiment described by Ronald Fisher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story is loosely based on a real event. Muriel Bristol, a colleague of Fisher, claimed that she could tell whether milk had been poured into a cup **before** or **after** the tea. Her future husband, William Roach, suggested setting up a simple experiment: give her eight cups of tea, four prepared milk-first and four prepared tea-first, in random order. She would then try to identify which cups were made by each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question Fisher asked was:  \n",
    "**If she were only guessing, what is the probability she would get her selections correct just by chance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual experiment, Muriel Bristol correctly identified all four milk-first cups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher’s analysis of this test is famous because it was the first time he formally introduced the idea of a **null hypothesis**.  \n",
    "The null hypothesis (or null model) represents a version of the world where the effect we are testing is set to zero. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null hypothesis:** Muriel Bristol cannot truly distinguish between milk-first and tea-first cups and is choosing cups randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fisher’s setup, there are eight cups in total — four milk-first and four tea-first — and the participant tries to pick the four milk-first cups. Under the null hypothesis, all selections are random, and we can calculate or simulate the probability of getting all four correct by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we recreate this experiment using Python and simulation to estimate that probability and compare it with the exact combinatorial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a clear description of the original experiment, see the Wikipedia article:  \n",

    "## Problem 1 — Extending the Lady Tasting Tea\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem I extend Fisher's Lady Tasting Tea experiment.  \n",
    "First I look at the original version with 8 cups (4 milk-first, 4 tea-first), and then I change it to 12 cups (4 milk-first, 8 tea-first).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is:\n",
    "- calculate the exact probability by combinatorics (using `math.comb`),\n",
    "- then approximate the same probability using simulation with NumPy,\n",
